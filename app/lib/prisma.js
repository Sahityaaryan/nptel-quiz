// This line ensures PrismaClient is stored in the global object only during development. That way:

//     In development, hot-reloading can recreate modules multiple times, and this would lead to multiple PrismaClient instances being created, which can crash your app or throw errors.

//     In production, this isn't needed because the app is started only once, and modules are not reloadedâ€”so a single instance is fine.
